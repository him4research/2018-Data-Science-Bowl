    "A true positive is counted when a single predicted object matches a ground truth object with an IoU above the threshold. A false positive indicates a predicted object had no associated ground truth object. A false negative indicates a ground truth object had no associated predicted object. The average precision of a single image is then calculated as the mean of the above precision values at each IoU threshold:\n",
